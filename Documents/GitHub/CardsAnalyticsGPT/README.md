# QueryGPT

This is an implementation of QueryGPT from Uber including 5 agents using LangGraphjs

The idea of the implementation is a POC for how would such setup work, where there is 5 agents:
- **Intent Agent** identifing the business domains the user is asking about with natural language
- **Table Agent** once handed off the business domains, the agent will decide from the database which table it can use.
- **Columns Agent** As now the knowledge includes the tables needed, the columns agent will make sure only the columns needed are included to prevent including extra data for no reason.
- **SQL Agent** turns eventually the prompt into a SQL query that can be executed on the database.
- **SQL Execution Agent** to run the query and return the results

## LLM and Library used
Currently defining the model used per agent, all of them for now are using `gpt-4o-mini` from OpenAI, through `@langchain/openai`

So please make sure you have an `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your environment.

## Dataset Used
Northwind for SQLLite from [SQLite3 version of Microsoft's Northwind Database on Github](https://github.com/jpwhite3/northwind-SQLite3?tab=readme-ov-file)

## Sample Output

```bash
$ node index.ts

========== Intent Agent Result ==========
The relevant workspace involved in your query is: Employee & Territories.
=========================================
========== Tables Agent Result ==========
Employees, EmployeeTerritories, Territories, Regions
=========================================
===== Column Pruner Agent Result =====
Based on your query, the relevant columns from the tables are as follows:

Employees: EmployeeID, LastName, FirstName, Title, TitleOfCourtesy, BirthDate, HireDate, Address, City, Region, PostalCode, Country, HomePhone, Extension, Photo, Notes, ReportsTo, PhotoPath
EmployeeTerritories: EmployeeID, TerritoryID

======================================
